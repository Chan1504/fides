This includes support for major privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR , CCPA and LGPD ) and standards like ISO 19944 by default. Fides can manage both enforcement of privacy in your CI pipeline and orchestration of data privacy requests in your runtime environment. TODO: Insert video - \"Below, Ethyca founder and CEO, Cillian Kieran describes how Fides can help solve common privacy challenges. Why is it called Fides? Fides was the goddess of trust and good faith in Roman paganism. Fides represented everything that was required for \"honor and credibility\" in every aspect of Roman life. In addition to this, Fides means \"reliability\": reliability between two parties, which is always reciprocal . As we considered naming conventions, Fides stood out for her embodiment of this project's philosophy - to provide developers with a powerful tool to make privacy a default feature of any software. If you'd like a brief Roman mythology lesson, check out Fides on Wikipedia . Key Features Privacy as Code You describe your datasets and code using Fides' high-level description language in human-readable, declarative manifest files. This allows you to create a consistent, versioned definition of privacy characteristics in your code to automate reporting, evaluate risk and execute policies against. Automated Privacy Checks Fides integrates with git using the fidesctl tool to allow you to automate privacy checks in your CI pipeline and evalute changes against your privacy policies on each commit. This allows you to review changes and assure they meet your privacy policies before deployment. Support all Privacy Standards Fides ships with a comprehensive taxonomy that allows you to efficiently describe the privacy behaviors of your system for major regulations, including GDPR , CCPA and LGPD as well as major standards like ISO 19944 . Extensible Taxonomy Fides' taxonomy can be easily extended, allowing teams to add support for system specific concepts or data types while inheriting concepts to ensure compliance with global privacy regulations. Automate Privacy Reporting Fides' declarations can be configurd to automatically generate privacy review reports suitable privacy and legal team review. This allows developers to focus on implementation while providing privacy teams with greater insight into the software's privac behavior. Data Privacy Rights Automation Fides' data orchestration capabilities mean you can use declarations to generate complex data rights automated processes that execute automatically against user's privacy rights requests. This allows you to easily configure automated, API driven privacy requests for access, erasure and de-identification of data. About Ethyca The Makers of Fides The mission of Ethyca is to make internet scale technology respectful and ethical. We're a venture backed privacy technology team headquartered in New York, but working as a distributed team across the US to solve what we believe is the most important problem in technology today, and that is - We believe the solution to this is low friction dev tools that integrate with your existing CI pipelines to make privacy a feature of your tech stack as effortlessly as any other feature of your system. Fides is a universally understandable, open source definition language on top of which we'll build privacy tools for the next decade. What We Believe Data privacy is a human right that should be a native feature of any respectful technology. Today building great privacy as a feature in software is friction filled and complicated. We're building open source privacy tools for the developer community because we believe the only way to achieve a respectful internet is to make privacy an easy-to-implement layer of any tech stack. The Future We've been working on this problem for three years already and have a clear view of our next five year. We're excited about the roadmap of features we'll add to Fides in order to make it comprehensive tool for addressing the major challenges of privacy in both the code management and runtime environments. This means building solutions for automated privacy analysis, as well as context rich data classification, automated data orchestration for privacy righs and semantic access control models. If you're interested in solving some of the toughest and most important problems facing internet scale data-driven software, join us now . Your Participation Fides' success is predicated on your participation -- Privacy as Code can only become a reality if we ensure it's easy to understand, implement and an interopable standard for wide adoption. Your feedback, contributions and improvements are encouraged as we work towards building a community with the sole objective of building more repsectful software for everyone on the internet.

While docker-compose is great for development and experimentation, it isn't suited to production use. The following guide will walk you through setting up each component of Fidesctl as a production-grade deployment. Requirements Install Postgres 12 Install Python 3.8 or newer (including pip) Install Fidesctl via pip -> pip install fidesctl Setup Step 1: Database Spin up a Postgresql DB and configure a user, password and database for Fidesctl to use. For example: 1 2 3 POSTGRES_USER=\"fidesctl_db\" POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"f1d3sctl_dB\" POSTGRES_DATABASE=\"fidesctl_db\" Step 2: Create a Config The next step is to create a fidesctl.toml config file. This is used to pass important variables to the Fidesctl applications for connections to the database, api, etc. Make sure that the username, password and database in the database_url connection string match what you used to configure your database. Fidesctl will automatically look for the fidesctl.toml file in the current directory, in the user directory, or at the path specified by an optional FIDESCTL_CONFIG_PATH environment variable. Additionally, any variable can be overriden by using a properly formatted environment variable. For instance to overwrite the database_url configuration value, you would set the FIDESCTL__API__DATABASE_URL environment variable. The following is an example fidesctl.toml : 1 2 3 4 5 [cli] server_url = \"http://localhost:8080\" [api] database_url = \"postgresql+psycopg2://fidesctl_db:fidesdb@localhost:5432/fidesctl_db\" Step 3: Fidesctl API Next we need to prepare the database to be used by the API. Run the initial database setup via the fidesctl CLI: 1 fidesctl init-db Now open a new terminal to run the API, as it will run there indefinitely: fidesctl webserver The webserver should now be available at localhost:8080 , and docs are available at localhost:8080/docs , however the API docs can be safely ignored, as the Fidesctl CLI will abstract the API layer. Step 4: Fidesctl CLI The last step is to check that everything is working! Open a new terminal window and run the following: fidesctl ping If everything is configured correctly, it will let you know that the command was successful!

In order to create a positive and welcoming environment, all interactions are governed by the Fides Code of Conduct . GitHub We have a public GitHub Repo for development and collaboration. GitHub Guidelines Whether it's giving us feedback, raising a question, or showing your Fides-related work, we are looking forward to hearing from you. The Fides community is vibrant because of the quality of its members and the discussions they bring. To keep the workspace inviting and helpful for everyone, there are a few guidelines that we ask all members to follow. Rule 1: Assume Positive Intent Being nice is the most important pillar of the Fides community. We are considerate to each other's effort and time. It's also easy to misinterpret people through Slack, so we make an extra effort to chat in a positive tone. We assume that you are here to learn and exchange ideas, and we ask that you contribute to making a welcoming community. If someone is helping you, be mindful of the effort they are putting in. While we are always happy to help users, we can not help users with step-by-step debugging. Use your professional judgment in discerning whether requests are unreasonable. The Fides team always tries to listen to the community. Please be understanding if your issue or feature request is not deemed an immediate priority. Rule 2: Use threads for larger messages Because of the size of our community and frequency of posts, it's easy for large messages to drown out smaller messages. Using threads helps people see more messages on their screen. Larger code blocks should be posted in threads. Rule 3: Avoid posting sensitive information Community members sometimes need to post code snippets as they ask for help. Be sure to remove sensitive information from posts to the public channels. If your Fides account information is needed to help you, we will ask you to direct message such information. Be cautious of anyone asking for information through direct messages. Rule 4: Write high quality questions The Fides community is here to support you. That said, it is significantly easier to answer well-researched and clearly-written questions. Even adding potentially relevant links to a post helps tremendously. Informative Slack threads are archived by our resident bot Marvin. Having well-written threads helps future users encountering the same problem. Oftentimes your question may have been answered somewhere else; some good resources to start looking before asking a question: Fides Documentation GitHub Issues StackOverflow Rule 5: Don't abuse tagging users Requests for help will be seen by the Fides team, and will be directed to the appropriate person. Tagging individual users is highly discouraged unless it is in the context of a conversation thread. Rule 6: Avoid using DMs to ask for help Fides employees should not be sent questions in DMs unless we specifically ask you to send us private information. There are times when it makes sense to directly message another community member experiencing a similar issue, or working with similar technologies. Just be aware that some people may not want to be messaged. It also helps other people if you post your question publicly. Similar to above, informative Slack threads are archived. Having conversations in public channels drives better quality discussions that can be referenced in the future. Rule 7: Don't advertise material unrelated to Fides Our community is in the channel to learn more about Fides. Showing us Fides-related stuff that you're working on is highly encouraged. Advertising products and events unrelated to Fides will be removed.","title":"GitHub"},{"location":"community/github/#community","text":"The Fides project welcomes issues, contributions and discussion from all users, regardless of background or experience level.

This section of the docs is designed to help you become familiar with how we work, the standards we apply, and how to ensure your contribution is successful. If you're stuck, don't be shy about asking for help on GitHub . Getting Started The first step is to clone the Fidesctl repo for development: 1 git clone https://github.com/ethyca/fides Once that's complete, there are a few different ways to spin up the project and get coding! Developer Workflows There are a few different ways to develop Fidesctl, they are listed below in order of how strongly they are recommended! If you're using VS Code, the recommended way to work on Fidesctl is by leveraging the Dev Containers feature. The repo has a .devcontainer/devcontainer.json file already included that will set up a complete environment in VS Code, including the suggested VS Code extensions and settings. Follow these steps to get started: Install the Remote-Containers extension for VS Code. Open the command window (the F1 key will open it, by default) and select the Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container... command. Click \"Open\", without having selected any specific folder. The containers will now spin up and VS Code will be running inside of the containers. The bottom left of the IDE will now say Dev Container: Fidesctl . When you open a new VS Code shell, it will be inside of the fidesctl container, and you'll have access to all of the fidesctl commands as well as any Python commands like pytest , black , mypy , etc. If you're using an editor besides VS Code, then the next best way to work on Fidesctl is by utilizing the Makefile commands: See the guide here for more information on getting set up via the Makefile Once you've gotten everything set up, run make cli to spin up a shell within the fidesctl container. You can and should run all of your various development commands from within this shell, such as pytest , black , etc. Finally, the least-recommended method would be to install the project in your local environment and develop directly. Write your code We have no doubt you can write amazing code! However, we want to help you ensure your code plays nicely with the rest of the Fidesctl ecosystem. Many projects describe code style and documentation as a suggestion; in Fidesctl it's a CI-checked requirement. To learn how to style your code, see the style guide . To learn how to document your code, see the docs guide . To learn how to test your code, see the tests guide . To learn what format your PR should follow, make sure to follow the pull request guidelines . Submit your code In order to submit code to Fidesctl, please: Fork the Fidesctl repository Create a new branch on your fork Open a Pull Request once your work is ready for review Once automated tests have passed, a maintainer will review your PR and provide feedback on any changes it requires to be approved.

There are a few important reasons to write tests: Make sure your code works Tests ensure that your code does the thing you intend it to do. If you have a function that adds two numbers, you'll want to test that it does, in fact, return their sum. If behavior depends on a configuration setting, ensure that changing that setting changes the behavior. In short, if you wrote a line of code, you should test that line works as expected. Make sure your code doesn't not work It may seem silly, but another important reason to write tests is to ensure that your code behaves as expected even when it's broken . This is especially important for a project like Fidesctl, which is focused on helping engineers when something unexpected happens to their code. For example, you could write tests about what you expect to happen if your function is called with incorrect (or no) arguments, or to ensure that any errors are properly trapped and handled. Tests are documentation Ultimately, your tests are the best documentation for your code. Another developer should be able to look at your tests and understand what your code does, how to invoke it, and what edge cases it contains. Therefore, try to write short, self-explanatory tests with descriptive titles. Help future developers As Fidesctl grows, your code will be reused in more and more places, by developers who may not be familiar with the details of your implementation. Therefore, your tests are an opportunity to ensure that your code is used correctly in the future. For example, if your code needs to be used in a certain way, or expects a certain configuration, or is always expected to return a certain output, or has any other details that might impact its ability to be used in the framework, write a test for it!

There are a few important reasons to write tests: Make sure your code works Tests ensure that your code does the thing you intend it to do. If you have a function that adds two numbers, you'll want to test that it does, in fact, return their sum. If behavior depends on a configuration setting, ensure that changing that setting changes the behavior. In short, if you wrote a line of code, you should test that line works as expected. Make sure your code doesn't not work It may seem silly, but another important reason to write tests is to ensure that your code behaves as expected even when it's broken . This is especially important for a project like Fidesctl, which is focused on helping engineers when something unexpected happens to their code. For example, you could write tests about what you expect to happen if your function is called with incorrect (or no) arguments, or to ensure that any errors are properly trapped and handled. Tests are documentation Ultimately, your tests are the best documentation for your code. Another developer should be able to look at your tests and understand what your code does, how to invoke it, and what edge cases it contains. Therefore, try to write short, self-explanatory tests with descriptive titles. Help future developers As Fidesctl grows, your code will be reused in more and more places, by developers who may not be familiar with the details of your implementation. Therefore, your tests are an opportunity to ensure that your code is used correctly in the future. For example, if your code needs to be used in a certain way, or expects a certain configuration, or is always expected to return a certain output, or has any other details that might impact its ability to be used in the framework, write a test for it!

For example, you might declare one dataset for your Postgres application database, a second dataset for your Mongo orders collection, and a third dataset for some CSV files in your storage buckets. The Dataset resource provides a database-agnostic way to annotate the fields stored in these systems with Data Categories, providing a metadata layer for other tooling to consume.

More than likely, there is someone in your organization that is responsible for creating privacy policies for protecting the company from a legal standpoint. The purpose of this privacy policy is to state what types of data are allowed for certain purposes of use. Understanding the policy This policy is comprised of rules that your system's privacy declarations are evaluated against. You might be able to help your legal counsel make this, or you can handle the creation of this if you understand the legal requirements well enough. Fides' privacy declarations provide rich metadata about your systems, the data categories they process, the data uses for that data, etc. Policies allow you to declare constraints on these declarations to decide what combinations to allow or reject at your company, providing a layer of automation to control data privacy at the source. For example, you might want policies like: - \"we only allow systems that use anonymized data for product analytics purposes\" - \"we do not allow systems to combine user-derived demographic and location data for marketing use\" - \"we never collect biometric data\" These are examples of \"policies\" that might be formal rules you follow today, or maybe they are already part of your code review or privacy review practices.

For example, you might want policies like: - \"we only allow systems that use anonymized data for product analytics purposes\" - \"we do not allow systems to combine user-derived demographic and location data for marketing use\" - \"we never collect biometric data\" These are examples of \"policies\" that might be formal rules you follow today, or maybe they are already part of your code review or privacy review practices.

(TODO: link to taxonomy reference) The Fides taxonomy for data categories is a standard adapted from ISO 19944 . This taxonomy provides descriptions of the types of sensitive, personally identifiable, or non-identifiable data that an organization could hold for any data subject. The hierarchical nature of the Fides taxonomy has a few notable benefits: Consistency: the taxonomy is used as a shared resource across your Fidesctl deployment(s). Because the taxonomy is derived from an international standard, it enables interoperability inside and outside of your organization. Natural inheritance: the hierarchy allows ease of reference to multiple subcategories or uncertain categorizations, simply by using a more superior data category. Extensibility: if the taxonomy is missing any data categories specific to your business, you can extend the taxonomy with whatever new values you need. The Fides Taxonomy is used across the Fides ecosystem of projects, fidesctl and fidesops. Why did we create the Fides Taxonomy? The Fides taxonomy was created because the industry is distinctly lacking a common definition of what Personal Data is, what identifiable data is, and how anonymized data has to be to be unidentifiable. The taxonomy provides this common classification and is a key component of implementing Privacy as Code. How to use the Fides Taxonomy The Fides project comes with 4 taxonomies of privacy attributes by default: Data Categories Data Subjects Data Uses Data Qualifiers Fidesctl comes loaded with these taxonomies by default and they can be found here fidesctl/src/fideslang/default_taxonomy.py . To extend this taxonomy for your business uses, you might want to add additional data categories to cover all the types of PII your business collects, or additional legal uses for the data. At Best Pizza Co, since we're expanding to new countries, we need to support Province, for example, as part of the user's provided address for delivery. We could accomplish this by adding the additional data category directly to default_taxonomy.py : (TODO: update this example to apply a Data Category resource file instead of editing source) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 + DataCategory( + fides_key=\"user.provided.identifiable.contact.province\", + organization_fides_key=\"default_organization\", + name=\"User Provided Province\", + description=\"User's province.\", + parent_key=\"user.provided.identifiable.contact\", + ), DataCategory( fides_key=\"user.provided.identifiable.contact.state\", organization_fides_key=\"default_organization\", name=\"User Provided State\", description=\"User's state level address data.\", parent_key=\"user.provided.identifiable.contact\", ), This will add the user.provided.identifiable.contact.province as a data category type as a subcategory of user.provided.identifiable.contact for your organization.
